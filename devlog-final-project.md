# Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express

## Final Project Devlog

### Scenario

I am a back-end developer working for an online bookseller. I need to develop a RESTful server-side application that manages book ratings and reviews. It must include the following features:

- Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
- Search for specific books and retrieve details based on ISBN, author name, or title
- Retrieve reviews and comments
- Register new users
- Log users into the app
- Add new reviews (logged in users only)
- Modify own book reviews
- Delete own book reviews
- Application must be concurrent.

### My to-do list

1. fork skeleton repo
2. Add JWT session authentication
3. Write CRUD endpoints

- test with Postman on the way

4. Ensure everything is asynchronous & concurrent
